## Features

- [x]  Pull-to-refresh
- [x]  Empty state
- [x]  Viper architecture
- [x]  Modular approach

## To-Dos

- [ ]  Unit tests nearly finished for the Gallery module. Few left to do due to time constraints
- [ ]  Documentation

## Requirements

- Use the most recent tools for the platform of your choice (iOS – Swift/Xcode or Android - Java /Android Studio or Android Java/Kotlin/Android Studio).

- Limit your usage of 3rd party libraries only to the few ones that add a large benefit to the architecture and testability of the project..

- Flickr url that should be used is: https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public.

- Image metadata should be visible for each picture

- Git should be used as version control and to track the application development

## Output
- Provide a link to the Github repository with a project.
